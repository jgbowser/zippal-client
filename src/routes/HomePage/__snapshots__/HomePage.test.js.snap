    what is Zip Pal?
  </h3>
  <p>
    Zip Pal was created out of that familure human need for connections. In these troubled times, it is so hard to just meet people.
    <br />
    That is where Zip Pal comes in! With Zip Pal, you can start a conversation with another random user anytime you'd like!
