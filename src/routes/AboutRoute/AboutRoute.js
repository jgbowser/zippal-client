          <h2>Where did it all start?</h2>
          <p>Zip Pal started as an idea to connect people during the hight of Covid 19. Many countries have isolation orders
            in place, restricting what people can do outside of their own homes. These restrictions are meant to slow the
            spread of Covid 19, but unfortunately also have several adverse affects to mental health.
